Performed live at the North American Saxophone Alliance Biennial Conference at Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ on March 3, 2020.

I. "We dance round in a ring and suppose, but the secret sits in the middle and knows." — Robert Frost

II. "Come Fairies, take me out of this dull world, for I would ride with you upon the wind and dance upon the mountains like a flame!" — William Butler Yeats

III. "I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance" — e. e. cummings

IV. "Everything in the universe has a rhythm, everything dances." — Maya Angelou

This was the last thing I did before the world changed.
